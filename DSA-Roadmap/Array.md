# Array Roadmap (Interview-Focused)

> Goal: Master array patterns before moving to next data structure
> Rule: Pattern > Quantity > Speed

---

## Phase 1: Fundamentals (Completed)

* Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
* Remove Element
* Merge Sorted Array
* Rotate Array
* Move Zeroes
* Contains Duplicate
* Binary Search
* Search Insert Position
* Find Peak Element

---

## Phase 2: Core Patterns

### Two Pointers

* Two Sum
* 3Sum
* Container With Most Water

### Sliding Window

* Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
* Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
* Minimum Size Subarray Sum
* Longest Repeating Character Replacement

### Prefix Sum / Kadane

* Maximum Subarray
* Maximum Product Subarray
* Product of Array Except Self

### Binary Search Variants

* Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
* First and Last Position in Sorted Array
* Search in Rotated Sorted Array

---

## Phase 3: Interview Favorites

* Merge Intervals
* Insert Interval
* Jump Game
* Jump Game II
* Trapping Rain Water
* First Missing Positive
* Find the Duplicate Number
* Gas Station

---

## Phase 4: Advanced (Later)

* Minimum Window Substring
* Sliding Window Maximum
* Largest Rectangle in Histogram
* Median of Two Sorted Arrays

---

## Matrix / Extra (Solve After Core)

* Spiral Matrix
* Rotate Image
* Set Matrix Zeroes
* Daily Temperatures
* Majority Element
* Longest Consecutive Sequence

---

## Spaced Repetition Plan

### Every 7 Days

* Two Sum
* Maximum Subarray
* Binary Search
* Move Zeroes

### Every 14 Days

* Product of Array Except Self
* Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
* Merge Intervals
* Jump Game

### Every 30 Days

* Trapping Rain Water
* Search in Rotated Sorted Array
* First Missing Positive

Rule:
If explanation takes more than 2 minutes → re-solve.

---

## Completion Criteria

* Identify pattern within 1–2 minutes
* Solve core problems in under 10 minutes
* Explain time and space complexity clearly
* 80% of roadmap completed

---

### Status

* Phase 1: Completed
* Phase 2: In Progress
* Phase 3: Upcoming
