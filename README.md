# 🚀 C++ & DSA Mastery Roadmap

**A structured, execution-first roadmap to master C++ and Data Structures & Algorithms — from fundamentals to interview-ready level.**

This repository is designed to be followed **step-by-step**, with **clear separation** between:

* C++ language mastery
* DSA problem solving
* Real-world projects
* Daily progress tracking

> **Goal:** Become confident in C++, strong in DSA, and portfolio-ready within ~6 months through consistent daily practice.

---

## 📌 Who This Repository Is For

* Students learning **C++ from scratch**
* Anyone preparing for **coding interviews**
* Developers who want **structured DSA practice**
* People tired of random tutorials and want a **clear execution path**

**Rule:**
📖 Read markdown files → ✍️ Write code only inside `code/`

## 🧠 How This Roadmap Works

### 1️⃣ Learn in Order

* Start from **Level 1**
* Do **not skip levels**
* Each level builds on the previous one

### 2️⃣ Practice Daily

* Solve problems
* Write code yourself
* Analyze time & space complexity

### 3️⃣ Build Projects

* C++ projects → language + OOP + STL
* DSA projects → real-world data structure usage

### 4️⃣ Track Everything

* Update `PROGRESS.md` **daily**
* Maintain streaks
* Track problem counts

---

## ⏱️ Time Commitment

* **Daily:** 2–3 hours
* **Total Duration:** ~6 months
* **Total Problems:** 200+
* **Total Projects:** 10–14

Consistency beats intensity.

## 📚 What You Will Learn

### 🔹 C++ (Language Mastery)

* Fundamentals & memory management
* Pointers & references
* Object-Oriented Programming
* STL containers & algorithms
* File handling
* Clean, readable, maintainable code

📄 See: **`CPP-PROJECTS.md`**

---

### 🔹 Data Structures & Algorithms

* Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
* Trees & Graphs
* Recursion & Backtracking
* Dynamic Programming
* Greedy, Bit Manipulation
* Advanced Data Structures (Trie, Segment Tree, DSU)

📄 See: **`DSA-PROJECTS.md`**

---

## 🧪 Practice Strategy

### Before Coding

1. Read problem carefully
2. Identify pattern (array, stack, DP, graph, etc.)
3. Think brute force first
4. Optimize
5. Write clean logic

### After Coding

* Analyze time complexity
* Analyze space complexity
* Test edge cases
* Document approach if needed

---

## 🗓️ Daily Routine (Suggested)

### Weekdays (2–3 hrs)

* 30 min → Learn concept
* 60 min → Solve 2 problems
* 30 min → Review + update progress

### Weekends (3–4 hrs)

* Weekly revision
* Solve harder problems
* Work on projects

---

## 🧩 Projects Overview

### C++ Projects

* Student Grade Calculator
* Banking System
* Library Management System
* Contact Manager
* To-Do List App
* (Optional) Mini Database System

### DSA Projects

* Array Visualizer
* Browser History Manager
* Expression Evaluator
* File System Navigator
* Social Network Analyzer
* Puzzle Solver
* Text Justification Engine
* Autocomplete System
* File Compression Tool

Each project reinforces **real problem-solving**, not toy examples.

---

## 📈 Progress Tracking

All progress is tracked in:

📄 **`PROGRESS.md`**

* Daily logs
* Problem counts by topic
* Project completion
* Streak tracking

> If it’s not tracked, it doesn’t exist.

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

You are interview-ready when you can:

* Write clean C++ without references
* Choose the right STL container instantly
* Identify DSA patterns from problem statements
* Solve medium problems in ~30–45 minutes
* Explain time & space complexity clearly
* Showcase 8–10 solid projects on GitHub

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

* Skipping fundamentals
* Watching tutorials without coding
* Copy-pasting solutions
* Ignoring complexity analysis
* Not revising old topics
* Inconsistent practice

---

## 🚀 How to Start (Right Now)

1. Open **`ROADMAP.md`**
2. Start **Level 1 → Week 1 → Day 1**
3. Write code inside `code/cpp/`
4. Log progress in `PROGRESS.md`
5. Commit daily

---

## 🔥 Final Note

This repository is not about speed.
It’s about **discipline, clarity, and execution**.

> **2–3 hours a day for 6 months can completely change your skill level.**

You’re not “learning C++ & DSA” anymore —
you’re **training like an engineer**.

Let’s build 🚀
